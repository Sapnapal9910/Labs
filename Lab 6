Assume that you are a Java Developer in XYZ Software Solution and tries to compile and run the

following thread program:

class ThreadClass implements Runnable {

public void run() {

System.out.println("Running thread...");

}

}

class Test {

public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception {

Thread thread1 = new Thread();

Thread thread2 = new Thread(new ThreadClass());

Thread thread3 = new Thread(new ThreadClass(), "Thread3");

Thread thread4 = new Thread("Thread4");

Thread thread5 = new Thread("Thread5", 5); //1

Thread thread6 = new Thread("Thread6", new MyClass()); //2

}

}

What happen when you compile and run the preceding program?

Select one or more:
 Program generates compilation error at //1
 Program generates compilation error at //2
 Program generates runtime error
 Program compiles successfully and displays Running thread...
